### XRAY Instrumentation
  Getting Xray configured was really challenging. I continued to have issues with the syntax in the user_activities.py file. Getting the time configuration was tripping me up for some reason. Spent way too much time one this. glad to be past it.

### CloudWatch Logs
 This step was fairly easy to implement.

Intillaly had problems with project running, getting an error about Rollbar not defined. I found that the "import rollbar" snipet was missing.
