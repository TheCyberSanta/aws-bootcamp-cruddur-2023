# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
## Required Homework
  
This week we were tasked with learning how to use containers to isolate the instance that will be running our application.
I reviewed the instructional video and completed the tasks for this week
While completing the docker files my github instance crashed and was very discouraged. I stopped for a couple days and came back. 
I was able to figure out how to return to a previous session. (Then i watched your video about commiting code) I wish i had seen that video earlier. 
I was able to complete the containers but had to troubleshoot many syntax errors along the way.
